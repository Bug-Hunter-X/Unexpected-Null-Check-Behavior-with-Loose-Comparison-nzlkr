This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to null checks and loose comparison.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using strict equality (===).  The issue arises from JavaScript's loose comparison, which can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing null and undefined values.  The solution uses strict equality to explicitly check for both null and undefined.
